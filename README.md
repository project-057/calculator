## What he can do?
* Nothing at the moment.

## What it should do?
* For B mark:
1. Evaluate expressions (Generally)
2. `variable_to_values` replace vars before `split_to_tokens`
3. Pass all tests that we should write.
* For A mark:
1. Add supporting of functions, using function pointers (cos, sin, tg, log, ln, sqrt, pow, abs, exp, real, imag, mag, phase)
2. Add supporting of complex numbers (All values is a real numbers but those that with i or j or what else quaternions we have in mathematics) 
In tech. task said that we can use library with complex numbers
3. Evaluate variable expressions
4. Replace all primitive operations to function with complex numbers
5. Add supporting of constants such as (Examples from tech. task: PI, e, j - мнимая единица (Idk why j is imagine number, while there is no i which is default imagine number))
